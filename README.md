This is a version of the retro "Tetris" game. I added a next shape visualiser, a special ability that you can use when the score hits a multiple of 500
and some nice sound effects. The controls for the game:
ESCAPE - quit the game and close the window;
SPACE - (in game) exit to main menu;
ENTER/RETURN - Flip the block;
TAB - force the block down;
The game uses the NumPy and pygame external library which you may need to install before runing.
